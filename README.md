# Drug Classification using Decision Trees And Random Forest ðŸ’Š

## Overview
This project utilizes decision trees, specifically employing Gini index, entropy, and random forest techniques, for the classification of patients into different drug categories. The decision tree models are trained and evaluated based on features such as age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio.

## Decision Tree Models
#### 1. Gini Index
- Decision tree built using the Gini index as the splitting criterion.

#### 2. Entropy
- Decision tree constructed using entropy as the splitting criterion.

#### 3. Random Forest
- Random forest ensemble constructed using decision trees with the Gini index as the splitting criterion.


## DatasetðŸ“ˆ
The dataset used for training and testing the decision tree models consists of instances with the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure Levels (BP)
- Cholesterol Levels
- Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio

## Results ðŸ“Š
Evaluation metrics and results for each decision tree model can be found in the project's output.
